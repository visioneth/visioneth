# V33X Beast Pack

**AI-Powered Crypto Trading Intelligence**

I build autonomous trading systems that run 24/7. AI does the scanning, detecting, and executing. I built the infrastructure so I don't have to stare at charts.

## Copy Trading Strategy

**Profile**: Vision33X on BloFin Copy Trading

My system scans every coin on BloFin every 5 minutes. When RSI hits extreme levels (>85 overbought or <15 oversold), the bot fires a trade with automatic TP/SL. The edge is simple: extreme RSI snaps back. It's mean reversion, powered by AI.

**Backtested Results:**

| Signal | Win Rate | Strategy |
|--------|----------|----------|
| BTC RSI > 90 | 66.7% | SHORT |
| SOL RSI < 10 | 67.6% | LONG |
| DOGE RSI > 90 | 65.6% | SHORT |
| DOGE RSI < 15 | 61.1% | LONG |

Every trade has a stop loss. Every winner gets closed green. The AI monitors 24/7 -- I don't have to sit at a screen.
