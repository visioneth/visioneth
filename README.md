## What I Learned Losing $780

60 days. 12+ strategies. Every one felt like the answer.

Three things I know now:

1. **Entries are not the problem.** RSI extremes find good entries every time.
2. **Exits are everything.** Sitting on a winner is the hardest skill in trading.
3. **One strategy. Tweaked. Not replaced.** Hopping resets the clock every time.

## Current Market (Feb 24, 2026)

ETH:  $1,823   down -5.0%
SOL:  $76.59   down -5.1%
DOGE: $0.091   down -6.2%

Fear & Greed:  EXTREME FEAR
Funding:       Positive across board — shorts collecting
```
